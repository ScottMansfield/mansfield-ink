To start the year with a *really* exciting piece of literature, I read
*[The Definitive Guide to Underwriting Multifamily Acquisitions](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B088B6DPGY/).*
My wife and I have recently begun investing in real estate. With an eye on the
future I wanted to get an idea of how larger buildings are analyzed. Instead of
repeating the details of the book (which is quite detailed) I will go over some
concepts I learned.

The book is a quick read if you like analysis of any kind. The author, Robert
Beardsley, is a member of
[Lone Star Capital](https://lonestarcapgroup.com)
who practice what they preach. This book is a detailed look into their
underwriting model.

# Underwriting

I had no idea what underwriting involved until I picked up this book. The only
interaction I had with the idea was when we bought our current house several years
ago. I think it was similar to how most people view it: they just keep asking for
more and more documents. Now it's becoming more important as we look at houses
in different areas of the country.

In effect, underwriting is financial analysis to make sure the property will work
out in the buyer's favor. There's many inputs, but it reduces to viability.

The most interesting tidbit is that everyone has their own underwriting model.
In retrospect this is unsurprising. It makes sense that everyone would have their
own perspective.

# Crowdfunding

With the advent of crowdfunded real estate platforms like
[Fundrise](https://fundrise.com/)
it's important for people to know what they're buying. I think this little book
is helpful in understanding the terminology. For those of you lucky enough to be
accredited investors, it's even more important to spend the time vetting the
deal maker's underwriting.

# Terminology

These are a few terms that were new to me:

* T12: The trailing 12 months of financial data
* Pro Forma: This seems to mean "as a formality" but in this book it's used to
  describe the outputs of the underwriting process.
* [Cap Rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationrate.asp): The
  most important number in commercial real estate. It's defined as the
  Net Operating Income / Current Market Value. This is a deep topic.

# Resources

The book mentions resources used in gathering data for the underwriting process.
I won't describe them all here, but I am leaving them as links so you can explore
at your leisure.
