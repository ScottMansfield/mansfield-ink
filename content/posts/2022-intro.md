It's 2022. The year the world will hopefully go back to normal. With a new year
most people will hope to be a better person in a year's time.
[Most people fail](https://discoverhappyhabits.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/).
This year I'm not hoping, I'm doing. I started this to keep myself accountable,
retain more of what I wrote, and inspire others to do the same.

Last year I noticed I had developed an addiction to screens and watching video
online. I didn't want to spend time reading, outside, or even, sometimes, with
family. I had a problem.

I created a time tracker spreadsheet to see where my time was being spent, and
discovered I had at least a few hours of wasted time *every day*. Instead of
complaining about how I wished a day would be 30 hours long I decided to reclaim
my lost time.

if you want to try this for yourself. It's not much overhead to track things for
a week, and I'm sure you'll find you're spending time in places you wish you didn't.


# Accountability

It is my goal this year, among other things, to **read 100 books** and write about
every one of them on this blog. Announcing publicly you're going to do something
will create your own social pressure, so here we are.

# Retention

Writing and discussing concepts

far better than only reading. By writing about every book I will be getting
far more value than if I had just read it and tossed it on the pile.

# Inspiration

I hope that this blog will help others and even inspire people to action. This
year I'm concentrating on self-improvement and discipline, so there will be many
posts on books like Eat That Frog! and Atomic Habits. Not everyone will read every
book, so these posts will serve someone looking for a quicker understanding.

# Onward

As I write this I have completed 10 books this year and written about 0. Time to
get started.
