Time is money. Money is time. How can you create more than 24 hours in a day?
Well, money. If you can pay someone to do things for you, then you get that time
back.

is all about how to make that happen.

# But I'm a Superhero

No, you're not. That's the problem. After reading
[The E-Myth Revisited](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0887307280/)
last year I've been fascinated by the idea of creating roles and systems early
in a venture, even with the same person filling every role. Defining these roles
makes delegating them easier when you need to scale. Once you're out of time in
the day, it makes sense to bring in someone to help. Virtual Freedom is about how
to add VA's (Virtual Assistants) to your team and delegate some of those roles.

# $10,000 an Hour

What can you do to make $10,000 in an hour? The short answer is: nothing you would
pay someone $25 per hour to do. The core of this book is do understand how lower
value tasks (and tasks you dislike or can't do) can be done by other people. To
be clear, lower value does not mean unimportant. It means you can be more
effective by not doing those things. Ducker stresses the importance of treating
other people as people and understanding the cultural differences in a global
team.

# 3 Lists to Freedom

Generating your
[3 Lists to Freedom](https://www.virtualstafffinder.com/3-lists-freedom/)
is a prerequisite for delegating any work. It consists of things you:

1. Don't like doing
2. Can't do
3. Shouldn't do

I tried this exercise and it was quite enlightening. I know, for example, that
I am not good at graphic design. Recently, in a side project with a couple friends,
we decided to instead pay someone else to make a logo for us. This person, in
Morocco, did a far better job than we ever could have. I'll discuss this more in
an upcoming review of
[Who Not How](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1401960588/).

The last list is the most interesting. To get a good list I used the time tracker
mentioned in the
[2022 Intro]({{< ref "/posts/2022-intro" >}})
post. This helps clarify where I'm spending my time to find things I just shouldn't
be doing. I think Ducker meant the reader to introspect their working time, but
it was a useful exercise for personal time as well. Turns out that watching YouTube
for 3 hours a day doesn't help me reach my goals.

# This Book is Comprehensive

I recommend reading it even if you don't think you have a need for a VA. Ducker
covers the whole process in detail, including:

* Roles
* Finding people
* Recruiting
* Interviewing
* Onboarding
* Training
* Managing
* Paying
* Growing
* Promoting


Ducker spends quite some time discussing how to grow VA's and make them feel valued.
I appreciate the time spent on cultural considerations, too, when he focuses on
VA's from the Philippines.
