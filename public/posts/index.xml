      <description>Eat That Frog! is like reading an extended listicle. The book goes over 21 ways to stop procrastinating and instead work on your goals.
Some of the techniques are geared toward incremental progress, while others are more for someone who has trouble completing a task. I am personally wired to consider a task done when it&amp;rsquo;s 100% completed. Even then, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel that I&amp;rsquo;m ready to complete something until I see a very clear path to the end.</description>

      <description>The Miracle Morning is one of those books you will either love or hate. It&amp;rsquo;s a prescription for a productive start to the day. Whether you take that medicine is up to you.
This book is actually what inspired me to start getting up early. I realized I spent a lot of time after my kids went to bed just watching videos and sometimes playing games. I&amp;rsquo;d stay up until after midnight and wake up just barely on time to get my kids to school.</description>

      <title>Book 5: The Handmaid&#39;s Tale</title>

      <description>This post will contain spoilers about the content of the book. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read The Handmaid&amp;rsquo;s Tale yet, I recommend you do.
To mix things up, I decided to read something that&amp;rsquo;s been on my to-read list for a couple years now. The Handmaid&amp;rsquo;s Tale is about a dystopian past in which a religious war broke out. Society gradually fell into an existence dominated by strict submission to religious law under penalty of death.</description>

      <title>Book 4: Who Not How</title>

      <description>Who Not How by Dan Sullivan and Dr. Benjamin Hardy flips the typical script upside down. Instead of concentrating on how to solve a problem yourself, you should instead look for people who can solve that problem for you. By delegating rather than doing, you can free your time to do higher level, higher value tasks.
This book revisits the same concept of $10,000 per hour work that we saw in Virtual Freedom.</description>

      <title>Book 3: Storing Up Profits</title>

      <description>Like anything BiggerPockets publishes, this book was great. Storing Up Profits was written by Paul Moore, an expert in the self-storage real estate market. I like these kinds of books because they tend to pack a lot into a small space.
Self-storage facilities are one of those ubiquitous businesses that are all over the place, but nobody notices them until they need to use them. They&amp;rsquo;re cheap and provide overflow storage for people in distress or in a transition period and households with too much stuff.</description>

      <description>Time is money. Money is time. How can you create more than 24 hours in a day? Well, money. If you can pay someone to do things for you, then you get that time back. Virtual Freedom by Chris Ducker is all about how to make that happen.
But I&amp;rsquo;m a Superhero No, you&amp;rsquo;re not. That&amp;rsquo;s the problem. After reading The E-Myth Revisited last year I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by the idea of creating roles and systems early in a venture, even with the same person filling every role.</description>

      <title>Book 1: The Definitive Guide to Underwriting Multifamily Acquisitions</title>
      <link>https://mansfield.ink/posts/book-1-definitive-guide-multifamily-acquisitions/</link>

      <description>To start the year with a really exciting piece of literature, I read The Definitive Guide to Underwriting Multifamily Acquisitions. My wife and I have recently begun investing in real estate. With an eye on the future I wanted to get an idea of how larger buildings are analyzed. Instead of repeating the details of the book (which is quite detailed) I will go over some concepts I learned.
The book is a quick read if you like analysis of any kind.</description>

      <title>2022 Intro</title>
      <link>https://mansfield.ink/posts/2022-intro/</link>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2022. The year the world will hopefully go back to normal. With a new year most people will hope to be a better person in a year&amp;rsquo;s time. Most people fail. This year I&amp;rsquo;m not hoping, I&amp;rsquo;m doing. I started this to keep myself accountable, retain more of what I wrote, and inspire others to do the same.
Last year I noticed I had developed an addiction to screens and watching video online.</description>
