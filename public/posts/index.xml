      <description>To start the year with a really exciting piece of literature, I read The Definitive Guide to Underwriting Multifamily Acquisitions. My wife and I have recently begun investing in real estate. With an eye on the future I wanted to get an idea of how larger buildings are analyzed. Instead of repeating the details of the book (which is quite detailed) I will go over some concepts I learned.
The book is a quick read if you like analysis of any kind.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2022. The year the world will hopefully go back to normal. With a new year most people will hope to be a better person in a year&amp;rsquo;s time. Most people fail. This year I&amp;rsquo;m not hoping, I&amp;rsquo;m doing. I started this to keep myself accountable, retain more of what I wrote, and inspire others to do the same.
Last year I noticed I had developed an addiction to screens and watching video online.</description>
