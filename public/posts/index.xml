      <description>Like anything BiggerPockets publishes, this book was great. Storing Up Profits was written by Paul Moore, an expert in the self-storage real estate market. I like these kinds of books because they tend to pack a lot into a small space.
Self-storage facilities are one of those ubiquitous businesses that are all over the place, but nobody notices them until they need to use them. They&amp;rsquo;re cheap and provide overflow storage for people in distress or in a transition period and households with too much stuff.</description>

      <description>Time is money. Money is time. How can you create more than 24 hours in a day? Well, money. If you can pay someone to do things for you, then you get that time back. Virtual Freedom by Chris Ducker is all about how to make that happen.
But I&amp;rsquo;m a Superhero No, you&amp;rsquo;re not. That&amp;rsquo;s the problem. After reading The E-Myth Revisited last year I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by the idea of creating roles and systems early in a venture, even with the same person filling every role.</description>

      <description>To start the year with a really exciting piece of literature, I read The Definitive Guide to Underwriting Multifamily Acquisitions. My wife and I have recently begun investing in real estate. With an eye on the future I wanted to get an idea of how larger buildings are analyzed. Instead of repeating the details of the book (which is quite detailed) I will go over some concepts I learned.
The book is a quick read if you like analysis of any kind.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2022. The year the world will hopefully go back to normal. With a new year most people will hope to be a better person in a year&amp;rsquo;s time. Most people fail. This year I&amp;rsquo;m not hoping, I&amp;rsquo;m doing. I started this to keep myself accountable, retain more of what I wrote, and inspire others to do the same.
Last year I noticed I had developed an addiction to screens and watching video online.</description>
