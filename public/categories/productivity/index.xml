      <description>Who Not How by Dan Sullivan and Dr. Benjamin Hardy flips the typical script upside down. Instead of concentrating on how to solve a problem yourself, you should instead look for people who can solve that problem for you. By delegating rather than doing, you can free your time to do higher level, higher value tasks.
This book revisits the same concept of $10,000 per hour work that we saw in Virtual Freedom.</description>
